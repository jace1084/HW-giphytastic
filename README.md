In this interactive app you will be able to provide your favorite Star Wars character's name in the input field, the app 
will then search the name and showcase the best "Gif's" of that particular Star Wars charachter. If you change your mind and 
wish not to include your choosen character, you will be able to remove the button (that was created with you selection) and 
start over. All buttons are removeable except for the buttons already provided through the app. The app will display 10 Gifs
and they will be "paused". In order to have the gifs play, all you need to do is click on any given gif. This will activate 
the play function of that "clicked" Gif...HAVE FUN!!
